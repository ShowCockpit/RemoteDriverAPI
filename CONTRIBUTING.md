## How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). If your issue is not related to the Remote Driver API, please use an appropriate channel to report the issue. If it is related to the Remote Driver API, create an issue on this repository.

Explain the problem and include additional details to help us reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. When listing steps, **don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it**.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include screenshots, links to files or a link to a video.
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
* **If you have any crash reports**, include them with a stack trace from the operating system: include the crash report in the issue in a [code block](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines), a [file attachment](https://help.github.com/articles/file-attachments-on-issues-and-pull-requests/), or put it in a [gist](https://gist.github.com/) and provide link to that gist.
* **If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action**, describe what you were doing before the problem happened and share more information using the guidelines below.

Provide more context by answering these questions:

* **Did the problem start happening recently** (e.g. after updating to a new version of ShowCockpit) or was this always a problem?
* If the problem started happening recently, **can you reproduce the problem with an older version of ShowCockpit?** What's the most recent version in which the problem doesn't happen? You can download older versions of ShowCockpit from [the website Downloads page](https://showcockpit.com/site/downloads/).
* **Can you reliably reproduce the issue?** If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.
